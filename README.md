## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- **Platform:** Wear OS
- **Key Packages:**
  - `wear_plus`: For adapting the UI to different watch shapes (round/square).
  - `wearable_rotary`: To enable navigation with the physical rotating bezel or crown.
  - `barcode_widget`: For generating the barcode images.
  - `shared_preferences`: For storing the barcode data locally on the device.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

There are two ways to get the app on your watch: by installing the official release or by building it yourself from the source code.

### For Users (Easy Install)

This method is recommended for most users. You will download the ready-to-install app file and sideload it onto your watch.

1.  **Download the latest release:**
    Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/your_username/wearcodes/releases) and download the latest `.apk` file from the "Assets" section.

2.  **Sideload the APK to your watch:**
    You will need to use a tool to install the APK file on your watch. This process is called "sideloading." It requires enabling developer options on your watch.

    For a detailed, user-friendly guide, follow the instructions here: [How to Sideload Apps on Wear OS](https://www.howtogeek.com/792549/how-to-sideload-apps-on-wear-os/)

### For Developers (Build from Source)

This method is for developers who want to modify the code or build the app themselves.

1.  **Set up Flutter:**
    If you don't have Flutter installed, follow the official guide to get started: [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/wearcodes.git
    cd wearcodes
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app (Debug Mode):**
    Connect your Wear OS device or start an emulator, then run:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

5.  **Build the app (Release Mode):**
    To build the release `.apk` file that you can install or distribute, run:
    ```sh
    flutter build apk --release
    ```
    The output file will be located in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

## Usage

- **Scroll Through Codes:** Use the rotary input (bezel/crown) on your watch to switch between saved barcodes.
- **Add a New Code:** Scroll to the very end of your list to find the "Add New Code" card and tap the `+` button.
- **Delete a Code:** Long-press on any barcode card to bring up the delete confirmation screen.

## üìù To-Do

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- [ ] Support more barcode formats (e.g., QR Code, Code 128).
- [ ] Allow reordering the list of saved codes.
- [ ] Add the ability to edit an existing code's name or data.
- [ ] Improve UI/add theme options.
- [ ] Investigate a companion phone app for easier code management.
